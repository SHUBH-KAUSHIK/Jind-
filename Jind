The ruling house of Jind belonged to the Phulkian dynasty, sharing a common ancestor named Tiloka with the Nabha rulers. Tiloka was the eldest son of Phul Sidhu of the Phulkian Misl.[3] The Jind rulers descend from Sukhchain Singh, the younger son of Tiloka.[4] The Jind State was founded in 1763 by Gajpat Singh after the fall of Sirhind.[3] Other sources give a date of 1768 for the founding of the state.[1]

Gajpat Singh, son of Sukhchain Singh and great-grandson of Phul, launched a rebellion against the hostile authority based out of Sirhind.[1] The rebellion was a Sikh coalition against the Afghan governors of Jind State.
